2.	A Miner Task
You will be given a sequence of strings, each on a new line until you receive the "stop" command.
Every odd line on the console represents a resource (e.g., Gold, Silver, Copper, and so on) and every even - quantity.
 Your task is to collect the resources and print them each on a new line.
Print the resources and their quantities in the following format:
"{resource} -> {quantity}"
The quantities will be in the range [1 … 2 000 000 000].

Gold
155
Silver

Copper

stop	Gold -> 155
        Silver -> 10
        Copper -> 17

Input	Output
gold
155
silver
10

        silver -> 10
